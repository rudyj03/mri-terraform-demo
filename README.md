# Terraform Intro Demo

Before and after code for a _Terraform Introduction_ class.

## Bare AWS

This branch is for use on a student's own AWS account and doesn't assume that the code is running inside the HashiCorp training VPC.

Major changes:

- A security group is created for SSH and HTTP
- The configuration only uses resources built by the configuration itself
